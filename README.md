# **Tee Tee Beam Girder Design with Python**

This repository contains Python scripts and resources for the design and analysis of Tee Tee Beam Girders, commonly used in structural engineering for bridge construction. The scripts provided here aim to facilitate the structural design process by automating calculations and providing visualizations of key parameters.

## Features

- **Design Calculations**: Python scripts to perform design calculations based on specified parameters such as load conditions, material properties, and geometric dimensions.
  
- **Visualization**: Tools to visualize the girder geometry, stress distribution, and other relevant structural properties using matplotlib or other plotting libraries.

- **Optimization**: Techniques for optimizing girder designs based on criteria such as weight, cost, or structural efficiency.
